# ShoppingBird
Application to help shop with the lowest price. Will add functionality for personal finance.

## How the application Works
The backbone of the application is that the end user enters invoices(by reading barcodes) from different stores into the software. The software then maintains a list of all items/products/goods with their specific prices for specific stores.

If the user wants to make a purchase, the application will suggest the stores that has the lowest price for the item(s) depending on the data available data.

The application can also give reports on user expenses.

### Improvements
Should communicate with store owners to convince them to give their product list/price list so that the end user does not have to enter the products into the database while entering the invoice.
